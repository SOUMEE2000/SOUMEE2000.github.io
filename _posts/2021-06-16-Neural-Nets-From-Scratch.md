# Neural Networks

<img src=">
          
This right above you is what is called a neural network. That's right ...thrown you right into the deep endðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­. Lots of lines and circles and even more lines and circles and they just keep coming at you. Now, for a moment if you could pretend in your mind's eye that's a black box, almost like a circuit board with input pins and output pins, I may be able to explain to you the intuition and reasonings about why we care(and we care a about this guy in machine learning) about something so complicated-looking anyway.Having established let's see if I could get you excited enough to even try hard coding this ;-). It's really just a bunch of simple things. Hold tight!!!!

## So why did someone want to build such a thing?

> "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience"
> Alan Turing
That was 1947 when Alan Turing said this. So, for years after that scientists kept on thinking...
                                                            
"but machines are idiots..if they could learn from experience....hmmm...what learns from experience...oh us!!!! Let's just try and replicate our brains then!!!!" And that was that!!. These neural networks are just a very very simplified representation of what goes on in our brains and how we learn from experiences stored in our brain. A connection of millions of neurons(just like those circles and millions of pathways just like those lines).
