# Neural Networks

<img src="https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/BLOG-Images/blob/main/Neural-nets/neuralnets1.jpg">
          
This right above you is what is called a neural network. That's right ...thrown you right into the deep endðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­. Lots of lines and circles and even more lines and circles and they just keep coming at you. Now, for a moment if you could pretend in your mind's eye that's a black box, almost like a circuit board with input pins and output pins, I may be able to explain to you how great an innovation this is and also the intuition and reasonings about why we care(and we care a lot about this guy in machine learning) about something so complicated-looking anyway. Having established let's see if I could get you excited enough to even try hard coding this ;-). It's really just a bunch of simple things. Hold tight!!!!

## So why did someone want to build such a thing?

That was 1947 when Alan Turing said this. So, for years after that scientists kept on thinking...
                                                            
*" but machines are idiots..if they could learn from experience....hmmm...what learns from experience...oh us!!!! Let's just try and replicate our brains then!!!!"*

And that was that!!. These neural networks are just a very very simplified representation of what goes on in our brains and how we learn from experiences stored in our brain. A connection of millions of neurons(just like those circles and millions of pathways just like those lines). Fascinating, isn't it, where the inspiration comes from and how it strikes them. We have come a long way since the 1950's with better algorithms but are nowhere near even with the best hardware available on earth, to reproduce what you have in your 5 * 5 * 5 cc skull. And there is a world of history and biology that I would have shared with you and probably I will write about them soon but I do encourage you exploring it on your own. You wouldn't be disppointed, I promise you.

## Let's get back to the big black box, shall we and see what goes inside it!!!
