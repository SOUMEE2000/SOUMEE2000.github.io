# **Neural Networks**

This right above you is what is called a neural network. That's right ...thrown right into the deep endðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­. Lots of lines and circles and even more lines and circles and they just keep coming at you. 
Now, for a moment if you could pretend in your mind's eye that's a black box, almost like a circuit board with input pins and output pins, I may be able to explain to you the intuition and reasonings about why we care(and we care a lot) about something so complicated-looking anyway. 
Having established let's see if I could get you excited enough to even try hard coding this ;-).
