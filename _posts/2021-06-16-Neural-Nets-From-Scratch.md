# Neural Networks

<img src="https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/BLOG-Images/blob/main/Neural-nets/neuralnets1.png?raw=true">
          
This right above you is what is called a neural network. That's right ...thrown you right into the deep endðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­. Lots of lines and circles and even more lines and circles and they just keep coming at you. Now, for a moment if you could pretend in your mind's eye that's a black box, almost like a circuit board with input pins and output pins, I may be able to explain to you how great an innovation this is and also the intuition and reasonings about why we care(and we care a lot about this guy in machine learning) about something so complicated-looking anyway. Having established that, let's see if I could get you excited enough to even try hard coding this ;-). It's really just a bunch of simple things. Hold tight!!!!

## So why did someone want to build such a thing?

> "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience"
>    --- Alan Turing

That was 1947 when Alan Turing said this. So, for years after that scientists kept on thinking...
                                                            
*" but machines are idiots..if they could learn from experience....hmmm...what learns from experience...oh us!!!! Let's just try and replicate our brains then!!!!"*

And that was that!!. These neural networks are just very very simplified representations of what goes on in our brains and how we learn from experiences stored in our brain. A meticulous connection of millions of neurons(just like those circles) and millions of pathways (just like those lines), which fire and interact amongst themselves. It's fascinating(isn't it?) to see where the inspiration comes from and how it strikes them. We have come a long way since the 1950's with better algorithms but even with the best hardware available on earth, we are nowhere near to reproduce what you have in your 5 * 5 * 5 cc skull. There is a world of history and biology that I would have shared with you and probably I will write about them soon but I do encourage you to explore it on your own. You wouldn't be disppointed, I promise you.

## Story Time!!!

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/123501617-d34bd200-d663-11eb-8a48-486c6c3779fd.png">

How do you describe something to a baby? Suppose you want a ten year old to distinguish between a cat and an elephant and given any breed of elephant or cat you want him to classify the creature correctly to its group. For an elephant you can say its got big ears, a trunk, a set of tusks and 4 feet. You could also describe it as something grey in colour, very tall and one with great strength. That too describes the elephant. You could also describe to the child the features of different breeds of elephants. And you would probably keep adding in more sets of features till the child gets some sort of an overall idea of how an elephant might look like. The same would go for the cat. And the next time the child sees a baby elephant on his way to school(ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚), based on what he has seen and understood previously, he is going to come to a conclusion.

So what you do is:
* You feed him a set of features called **X_input** and provide a label to those features known as **X_output**
* Then you give him a new set of features called **X_input** and you want his opinion on the **X_output**
* Mathematically, what you want to find out is **X_output - X_predicted_output** which is the error ( let's not expect the child to know everything at the first shot...learning is an **iterative** process)

That error will probably come in because he couldn't remember what was told(thinking of your cooking perhaps?). So, the next time if he labels an elephant as one(error = 0), that's great. But the odds are he will make some mistakes and as the complexity of the classification increases (classifying a healthy leaf from an unhealthy one) the chances of error due to such personal biases to one only set of parameters will be pretty costly.

One objective way to teach him this would be to reduce the error by trying to look at how he approached the problem, trying to tinker with his thoughts for a bit and in general trying to fix his biases towards particular features. Ask him to go over those features once again fix his errors and then proceed to do so for all the sets of features you have. Now, you realise perhaps that this is hardly the best way to make a child learn (more on that later) but that's how a neural network does it. You can understand almost any algorithm if you abstract it to a real-life situation as this and this may seem very primitive but it is the cornerstone for many great ideas. 

To summarise, the algorithm is:
* You feed him a set of features called **X_input** and provide a label to those features known as **X_output**
* Then you give him a new set of features called **X_input** and you want his opinion on the **X_output**
* Mathematically, what you want to find out is **X_output - X_predicted_output** which is the error
* Teach the child by looking at what error he makes and then back to the 1st step
* Repeat it for all the sets of features possible.

The goal here is to know enough about the algorithm to be able to implement it and that's what we shall proceed to do. Do brace yourselves for a lot of maths.

## The Ground-work

Let's segment out the the basic unit of the neural net and see what exactly does it do. It's this one right here. Also known as a **perceptron**. What it does is take a vector of inputs into it. Now, what might that vector be. In the context of the previous example, it's the vector of features. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/123503141-9802d080-d66e-11eb-99df-69be1dd35716.png">

**X_input = [ 4, large, tusks, teeth ]**

But the computer can not understand such a representation . What it understands are numbers, tonnes and tonnes of numbers and it will happily keep on calculating them without fatigue. So, suppose we make a table like this:


| Number of feet   | Size   |  Colour  |  Tusk present |
| :-----------:    | :-----:|  :----:  |   :-------:
| 4                | 100    |  2       |  4            |
| 4                | 5      |  1       |  0            |

The letters and numbers have been given particular integer values, or they have been encoded into a format that the computer can easily understand and there have been innovations in this too, things like **one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, hash encoding and all**. In fact we intend to use one-hot encoding for the outputs. But let us understand the representation of input features first.

In the above example, 2 in the colour column means brown and 1 means grey, like the indices we have in maps. So our X_input from the previous example is **[ 4, 100, 2, 4]**. We then feed it into the perceptron. Let's think a bit logically now. We have 4 numbers with us. The plan is that we do some operation on these numbers to get a single value. If that value is above a threshold value then the features correspond to a cat or they are the features of an elephant. So, what operation can make that happen? Addition? It would make sense. The size of a cat would have to be realistically 1 if the size of an elephant is 100. That in itself could create a very big segregation if we are adding things up as the sum for a cat would avrage around 10-20 while that for an elephant would be 100-115. Similarly, think about other operations that we could do with these numbers and that will be your very own algorithm!!!!!

So far as the predictions are concerned, the net is not going to be able to predict exact words like "elephant and "cat". So, there is this trick called one-hot encoding to teach the neural net just that. Let's append to our small dataset these two rows. And this is that encoding. Simple but very efficient. 1 in the cat column means it's cat and 0 in the same means it isn't. So, our **X_input** is the first 4 columns and **X_output** are the last two. And normally, this is what a dataset looks like too only with a lot more data.

| Number of feet   | Size   |  Colour  |  Tusk present |   Elephant   |    Cat   |
| :-----------:    | :-----:|  :----:  |   :-------:   |  :--------:  | :------: 
| 4                | 100    |  2       |  4            |      1       |     0    |
| 4                | 5      |  1       |  0            |      0       |     1    |

But let's pause for a bit. What if we have a baby elephant, a newborn one. He would have a size of 20 perhaps. Suppose for a minute that he was born without or tusks. It is indeed a sorry state of affairs(only a toy example) but then his number would add up to within 25. But that is closer to a cat than to an elephant. On the other hand we can assuredly say that a cat never grows to anything more than size 10. So, maybe the deciding factor here was not the other features but its size.

Just like in our everyday lives some jobs have more priority than others, the size of the animal should have a higher priority than the more generic features such as the number of feet. That is because the size has a grater contribution to the final decision than the other factors. Both cats and elephants have 4 feet(barring exceptions) so just by telling a kid about the 4 feet won't help him guess the features of the elephant. Ponder about it for a bit!!!!. But one way we can assign "priorities" is multiplying weights to these i.e., we take the weighted sum of 1* 4 + 4* 100 + 1* 2 + 1* 4. So, of course the threshold is going to change but the decisions that we are going to make should have more real-life significance. Similar to this some factors also should have lesser weights than what we have chosen right now. You can probably think of countless examples in which you would want to modify those weights in a certain way. And this people, is the **feedforward part**.

Generally, a perceptron does so by looking at the error it has produced and modifying its priorities accordingly, something called **Backpropagation**. 

## The Math for the feedforward part

The process by which the input to a perceptron move forward through it is what is called the feedforward part of the algorithm. And that calculation above definitely looks familiar. Pretty much the same thing happens for matrix multiplication, doesn't it?

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clarge%20%7B%5Ccolor%7BDarkGreen%7D%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%204%20%26%20100%20%26%202%20%26%204%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%7B%5Ccolor%7BRed%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%201%5C%5C%204%5C%5C%201%5C%5C%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D%20%3D%20%7B%5Ccolor%7BBlue%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%201*4%20&plus;%204*100&plus;%201*2&plus;%201*4%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%20%7D%20%3D%20%7B%5Ccolor%7BBlue%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20410%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D)

The red matrix has the weights and the green one contains the feature values. The python code for the above calculation is.

```
import numpy as np

X_input = np.array([4,100,2,4])
weights= np.array([1,4,1,1])
sum = np.dot(X_input, weights.T) + 0.02
```
But what is that 0.02? Well that is known as the bias term. 


![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clarge%20%5Csum%20X_%7Binput%7D%20.%20W%5E%7BT%7D%20&plus;%20b)

And on the whole this equation should look very similar. It is of the form **Y = MX + C**, back from the linear algebra days. That is the function of a straight line with slope M and and intercept c!!!. **But how did it end up here???** 

This is the line a perceptron draws.

Suppose we want to classify a dog and a cat only based on the features colour and size. So, on a graph each of those points would map to a pair of (x,y) co-ordinates.  On such a 2-D plane, imagine that the perceptron draws the above mentioned line separating the red dots and blue dots ( elephants and cats). At first we start off with a random line and then we keep on tuning the parameters of the line by modifying the biases and weights until we get a decent enough line that can properly separate the red dots and blue dots. So, any new point would fall on either side of the line and the perceptron would say that this hey this point seems to be on this side of the line that I have learnt to draw.!!!!

<img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/123555006-a2bd8280-d7a0-11eb-9fdd-d4be12866cbd.png">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/123687276-5ccef000-d86e-11eb-8bd1-a0c3456f3626.png" style="float:right">

If we consider 3 features, then the plotting will be on the basis of (x,y,z). So, there will be a plane separating the two groups of points. For d features, it will be a d-dimensional feature space but obviously that is pretty hard to imagineðŸ˜…. We are almost there, now. The network can make a decision for itself. It might be right or it might be wrong but it **can** decide for itself. 

Do, you realise that the you have entirely transformed a real-life problem into something of linear algebra from high-school?

There is however just a little bit of work left and that little somthing is known as an **activation function**. 

**Activation Functions:**

So, what we tend to do with the output that we calculated using the above formula is pass it through this function to give some non-linearity to the network. What is non-linearity now? Below is the graph of the sigmoid function. We squish the sum of anything that we get into 0 and 1 because our output features are labelled like that. And later we have to be able to compare what we have and what the network predicted to know if it's right or not. Also, the second of the infinitely many reasons is we must realise at the end of the day we are not going to have such clean data that we can easily separate it with the help of a straight line(what if the red points and blue point are arranged in a circle?). So, to curve the decision boundary a bit the activations functions are used. For now, please accept that this is what it is. This topic in itself is a broad area of research but for the purposes of this article we need not get so bothered about it. I will slip in a few links at the end for further reading. ^_~ 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/124066686-bdb91c80-da56-11eb-85b5-58f0b37454ae.png">

```
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))

predicted_output = sigmoid(predicted_output)
```

## The Math for backpropagation

**Loss function:**

For the elephants and cats classification example we did have the labels ready with us didn't we? That is while asking the child for the correct answers we should know the true labels ourselevs. And then we can compare. Similarly, the loss function or the error is: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/124061357-5a29f180-da4c-11eb-8df2-64e2d37b5d18.png)

If we plot this function on a graph, with respect to the weights we should have a surface that dips at certain places. That is corresponding to the minimum error and that is what we want. What is in our hands are the weights and the biases and that is what we need to modify in order to get the minimum error situations. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/124068948-070a6b80-da59-11eb-8561-086ba24eb133.png">

And with increasing number of epochs the training should happen in the direction of low error as indicated by the black path. So, how do we find out that direction? We take the gradients or the slope or the derivative of the loss function with respect to its weights and keep modifying it.  This too is the most primitive of all the algorithms that have since been invented and work is going on this area as well.

```
def gradient(x):
  return x * (1-x)

 error = (Y- predicted_output)
 adjustment = error * gradient(predicted_output)   ### gradient descent
 weights += 0.01*np.dot(X.T,adjustment)     # input_samples.T is transpose so that matrix dimension matches
```
The math for gradient descent is definitely a bit hard. The idea is that error for one particular neuron is going to depend directly on the weights that produced it. It is all calculus. The theory for the algorithm is going to be the subject of an upcoming post. But the results that the long-winded calculation yields are:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/124090711-b869cb00-da72-11eb-9bf3-216b4721fc00.png)

And this is because what we really want to calculate is the change in weights and biases w.r.t the error function. Please note that I have not included delta b or change in bias in any of the following code samples simply because it is easier not to. Once you finish reading to the end you can add in your own biases.
And you should see the error decreasing over time and the accuracy increasing. But this one perceptron can go only so far as to draw a straight line whoch we have already discussed is impractical for most real world data distributions. So, introducing multiple perceptrons should give better boundaries.

From here afterwards nothing theoretical is going to happen because I think that's enough theory for one blog-postðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. I will just run you down the essentials of the code you will find in this [colab notebook](https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/Machine-Learning-Stash/blob/main/Neural%20Networks/Neural_nets_From_Scratch.ipynb). Go through this first as all the standard steps for preprocessing the data is in there. Also this net gave a 95.5% accuracy on the Iris Dataset.

## Single-layer perceptron

The most important part about coding this is to be very meticulous about handling the matrix dimensions.

```
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

X= np.array([[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]])
Y= np.array([[1,0],[0,0],[0,1],[0,1]])
```
Let's try and visualise the network for a bit.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52605586/123691795-aa9a2700-d873-11eb-9e80-652153f2b2bb.png">

Points to be noted:
* Here my X is a set of 3 features....for each of the four animals I want to teach my neural net about.
* Dimensions of X :  4 * 3
* My Y is a one-hot encoded vector. 
* Dimensions of Y :  4 * 2

```
#### Weights
np.random.seed(10)
weights = np.random.random((3,2))
```

Here we just randomly initialised the weights. Why do you think the dimensions of the weight matrix are 3 * 2? Take a look at the network.
The weight matrix is:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B200%7D%20%7B%5Ccolor%7BDarkBlue%7D%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20W_%7B11%7D%26%20W_%7B12%7D%20%5C%5C%20W_%7B21%7D%26%20W_%7B22%7D%20%5C%5C%20W_%7B31%7D%26%20W_%7B32%7D%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D">

```
#activation function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))

epochs = 100
for i in range(epochs):
    sum = 0.02 + np.dot(X,weights)
    predicted_output = sigmoid(sum)
    
    # Backprop algorithm
    error = (Y- predicted_output)
    adjustment = error * gradient(predicted_output)   ### gradient descent
    weights += 0.01*np.dot(X.T,adjustment)     # input_samples.T is transpose so that matrix dimension matches
```

In the end we just have the feedforward part and the backpropagation part and we do this process for a total of 100 times, each time updating the weights which also translates to the child trying to get the intuition for the data you have given him to train.

## Multi-layer perceptron

This below here is the code for an MLP, which I just encapsulated within a class for better modularity. The code is exctly similar. So, try and find out the similarities first. We have the same backprop algo and the same feedforward algorithm. Only difference is we need to take  care of more number of weights and biases. Thus the extra loops. Same things are calculated and appended to extra lists to keep track of them.

Only thing I had to take care of was defining the dimensions of the weight matrices in the second function.

```
class neural_network():

  def __init__(self):
    self.weights=[]
  
  def network(self, input_layer, output_layer, learning_rate):

    predicted=[]
    input=input_layer
    for i in self.weights:
      X_input_hidden= np.dot(input, i)
      predicted_output_hidden= sigmoid(X_input_hidden)
      predicted.append(predicted_output_hidden)
      input= predicted_output_hidden

    error=[]
    error_output = predicted[-1]- output_layer
    error.append(error_output)
    self.weights.reverse()
    
    for i in self.weights:
      error_hidden= np.dot(error_output,i.T)
      error.insert(0, error_hidden)
      error_output= error_hidden

    self.weights.reverse()
    error = error[1:]
    adjustment = error[0] * gradient(predicted[0])   ### gradient descent between input-hidden layer
    self.weights[0] -= learning_rate * np.dot(input_layer.T,adjustment)

    for i in range(0,len(self.weights)-1):
      adjustment = error[i+1] * gradient(predicted[i+1])
      self.weights[i+1] -= learning_rate * np.dot(predicted[i].T, adjustment)

    return (self.weights, predicted[-1]- output_layer)

  
  
  def training_network(self, epochs, inputs, outputs, no_of_hidden_neurons, learning_rate):
    
    h= no_of_hidden_neurons
    self.weights.append(np.random.random(size=(inputs.shape[1],h[0])))
    
    for i in range(0,len(no_of_hidden_neurons)-1):
      self.weights.append(np.random.random(size=(h[i], h[i+1])))
    self.weights.append(np.random.random(size=(h[-1], outputs.shape[1])))

    for i in range(epochs):
      for j in range(len(inputs)):
        self.weights, error_output = self.network(np.array([inputs[j]]), outputs[j], learning_rate)

      print("For epoch %d error: %.3f " %(i, error_output.mean()))

    
  def predict(self, X_test):
    results=[]
    for j in X_test:
      input=j
      for i in self.weights:
        X_input_hidden= np.dot(input, i)
        predicted_output_hidden= sigmoid(X_input_hidden)
        input= predicted_output_hidden
      results.append(np.argmax(predicted_output_hidden))

    return results
```
