##  Web-Scrapping

Now, if we are about to get started on the subject let's just get our objectives straight. Web-scrapping simply means to scrap the contents of a web-page by looking at its html(more on that later). But why is such a simple and unrelated thing mentioned in a blog-site for machine learning? The answer is simple.

Machine learning is all about data and it can be sometimes immensely helpful to be able to gather data and create one's own datasets for testing the model or just adding data to it in general.  So, without delay, let's get started.

This time we take the help of two python libraries:
* bs4(for web-scrapping)
* requests(for fetching the webpage from the site)

Both the libraries can be installed using:
