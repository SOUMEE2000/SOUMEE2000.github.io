##  Web-Scrapping

Now, if we are about to get started on the subject let's just get our objectives straight. Web-scrapping simply means to scrap the contents of a web-page by looking at its html(more on that later). But why is such a simple and unrelated thing mentioned in a blog-site for machine learning? The answer is simple.

Machine learning is all about data and it can be sometimes immensely helpful to be able to gather data and create one's own datasets for testing the model or just adding data to it in general.  So, without delay, let's get started.

This time we take the help of two python libraries:
* bs4(for web-scrapping)
* requests(for fetching the webpage from the site)

Both the libraries can be installed using:

<!--more-->
```yaml
pip install bs4
pip install requests
```

And we are good to go!!!!

Import the libraries using:

```yaml
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```

Let's get started.

At first we mention the url of the web-page we want to visit and call the requests library to fetch the contents of the web-page for us. The page variable stores the response.
```yaml
url="https://blackadderquotes.com/blackadder-series-4-episode-1-captain-cook-full-script"
page= requests.get(url)
page 
```

This should give a response of status 200 meaning that everything has gone on well and without any sort of trouble.

**Let's get our hands dirty with some web-scrapping then**

```yaml
soup= BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
soup
```
This should return all the html content of the page. In fact, you can go to the settings of the page, then Developer tools, then elements to verify that all of the html has indeed been copied from there. But why do we need the entire contents? All we need is some selective portion of the data and have it to ourselves in an understandable format.
