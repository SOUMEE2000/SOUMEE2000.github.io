### A bit about myself:

I am a sophomore at an engineering college, taking a fully immersive course on computer science.
I am very keen on exploring and learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and I am actively working on areas like Natural Language Processing, Remote Sensing, GANs, Image Processing. In these blogposts I intend to share and contribute to the community by teaching people in the simplest way I know and adding my own style of wrtiting to it. I do hope these posts can encourage innovation and boraden your perspectives about simple concepts and inspire wonder and appreciation about the same in the readers.

I always welcome constructive criticism and that would help me learn too. You can write down your issues [here](https://github.com/SOUMEE2000/soumee2000.github.io/issues/new). I would love to connect on linkedin or github.
