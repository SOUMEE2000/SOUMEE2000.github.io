Hello there, people!

U-Nets are the first thing I learnt about when I decided to give Medical Image Processing a shot. They are currently the state-of-the-art models in this field and a lot of the newer models ( we will discover them eventually) use this very structure as a backbone and try and improve upon them. Down below is an image of a vanilla U-Net.

# Residual U-Net

# BCDU-Net

# DU-Net

# Spatial Attention U-Net

And coding them is pretty challenging at first, not gonna deny. And maybe that's something I will do for a later blog-postüòÅ but until then üëã.
