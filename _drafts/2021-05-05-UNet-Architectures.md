# Hello there, peopleü§ó!

**U-Nets** are the first thing I learnt about when I decided to give Medical Image Processing a shot. They are currently the state-of-the-art models in this field and a lot of the newer models ( we will discover them eventually) use this very structure as a backbone and try and improve upon it. And just in case your eyes haven't already wandered down to the picture, this is the architecture we plan to study.

## U-Net

The nomenclature, I beieve should be fairly obvious ü§≠ but if you are fairly new to it, the mind should be abuzz with a lot of questions!!!

**To name a few**:
* Why U ??? !!!!
* How U ??? !!!!
* What exactly is the meaning of U ??? !!!

# Residual U-Net

# BCDU-Net

# DU-Net

# Spatial Attention U-Net

And coding them is pretty challenging at first, not gonna deny. And maybe that's something I will do for a later blog-postüòÅ but until then üëã.
